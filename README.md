# KYX Parser Repository

This repository contains the source code and related assets for the KYX Parser project. Its primary goal is to parse KYX files and generate Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), ultimately turning them into Python gym environment.

## Repository Structure

Below is an overview of the main directories and their contents:

*   **`AST_parser/`**
    *   **Purpose:** This is the most critical folder in the repository, housing the core logic for parsing, AST generation, and related utilities.
    *   **Key Files:**
        *   `ast_config.py` (or `ast_config.ipynb`): Containing PyAST Configuration nodes.
        *   `gym_generator.py` (or `gym_generator.ipynb`): Responsible for generating "gym" environments, based on the parsed PyASTs.
        *   `keymaerax_parser.py`: The main AST parser implementation specifically designed for Keymaerax syntax.
        *   `PyAST_test.py` (or `PyAST_test.ipynb`): Manual end to end testing code for the system from KeymaeraX_file to Gym environment

*   **`documents/`**
    *   **Purpose:** Stores documentation and notes related to the project.
    *   **Contents:** Includes Markdown (`.md`) files explaining how the system works, design decisions, and meeting notes.

*   **`kyxs/`**
    *   **Purpose:** Contains sample or test KYX files.
    *   **Contents:** `.kyx` files that can be used for future testing, development, and validation of the parser.

*   **`sandbox/`**
    *   **Purpose:** A dedicated area for experimental code, proofs-of-concept, or temporary scripts that are not yet integrated into the main codebase.

*   **`test/`**
    *   **Purpose:** Houses all testing-related assets for the system.
    *   **Contents:**
        *   `input/`: Sample input data used for testing.
        *   `output_AST/`: Expected or generated AST outputs for comparison.
        *   `output_PyAST/`: Expected or generated Python AST outputs.
        *   `test_AST.py`: Test scripts specifically for the AST generation process.
        *   `test_PyAST.py`: Test scripts for the Python AST components.

*   **`.venv/`**
    *   **Purpose:** A virtual environment for Python dependencies, ensuring project isolation and reproducible environments.

*   **`_pycache__/`**
    *   **Purpose:** Python's bytecode cache directory, automatically generated.

*   **`archived/`**
    *   **Purpose:** Contains older or deprecated files/folders that are kept for reference but are no longer actively used.

*   **`logs/`**
    *   **Purpose:** Stores log files generated during the execution of various scripts or the system itself.

*   **`README.md`**
    *   **Purpose:** This file, providing a high-level overview and explanation of the repository structure and project.
